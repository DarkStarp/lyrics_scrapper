weigh\\nJust walkaway.\\n\\nSeek To Hide\\n\\nLet the wind blow\\nThe echoes away\\nLets plug in the audio\\nAnd run faraway.\\n\\nHiding under ember\\'s glow\\nBurning gently into the night\\nWelcome to the jitterbug studio\\nFor a discussion erudite\\n\\nYou may wish to stay\\nOr catch a glance\\nYou might be lucky today,\\nTo win\\nA chance \\nTo finance\\nThe romance.\\n\\nCoincidental Accident\\n\\nSome days we know\\nThe signs from universe\\nAre not enough.\\n\\nBut the patterns remain,\\nintricately woven\\nIn our beehive minds.\\n\\nA name in a movie,\\nA missed call\\nA motif to be drawn.\\n\\nRetrograding to the time\\nWhen things made sense\\nThe mind was but a pawn\\nInfatuated and infected,\\nBy fallacies of mortal soul.\\n\\nAcquaintance in Abundance\\n\\nI run towards the morning sun\\nOnly to find headlamps bright\\nPosters, oranges, hopes and smiles\\nIn abundance I pack.\\n\\nWhere do I live some ask;\\nOn a concrete bed with potholes\\nUnder the north star\\nWith a tabby cat with crescent scar\\n\\nIs this real life some ask;\\nWe are what we empthasize with\\nHonk, curse, rush and fall\\nAll we are but a face, hanging;\\nAmidst the bedlam, full of chaos.\\n\\nHi, biscus\\n\\nChivalry and Shrivelry,\\nHeroic and Stoic,\\nWhy pluck a new leaf\\nfrom the tree of life,\\nTake an old petal, chief;\\nWrinkled with wisdom,\\nRich with rife.\\n\\nEnd of the line\\n\\nEvery day ends,\\nYet life bills are put on boards.\\n\\nHiding in virtual,\\nIn reality, we fold.\\n\\nLife may be on the fast lane,\\nAt the end of the tunnel, we need someone to hold.\\n\\nIt\\'s a bird. \\nIt\\'s a plane.\\nIt\\'s just another blip.\\nIn the skies unknown.\\n\\nMoving away from merryland\\nInto the grey\\nTo make mistakes,\\nTo fall prey.\\n\\nPrey to desires,\\nPrey to fame,\\nIt\\'s a bird,\\nWaiting to become a plane.\\n\\n'"
